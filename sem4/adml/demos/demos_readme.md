# Comments about the Demos

The Demos:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Feature Engineering
- Principal Component Analysis
- Recurrent Neural Networks 

can be executed on renku. Eventually the memory of the container needs to be increased before starting a session. 
The Demo *Generative Models* needs to be downloaded and run on Google collab as else, the training of the model will be too slow.
The *German Sentiment Analysis* is best executed locally or on Google Collab as an extensive number of special packages is needed.
