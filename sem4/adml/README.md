# ML ADML HSLU

## Introduction

This is a Renku project - basically a git repository with some
bells and whistles. This is how to do the exercises on Renku. 

## Fork the Project

After Clicking on the ML ADML HSLU Project, you have a button "Fork" on the overview tab. When clicking on it you can duplicate this repository in your own namespace.

Below you see the prompt you get when clicking on the Fork Button, you don't need to change anything just click on "Fork Project". (You won't get the title error as I do, because you don't have this repository yet.)

This has the advantage that you can save the changes to your notebook while working on it. When now going on your project page you have two "ML ADML HSLU" project one with your namespace - this is the one you need to use from now on. 
**Always use the ML ADML HSLU project with your name below**

When opening a session the first time after forking the project, you will encounter the Docker Image no available Error. This is not a problem, just click on building the branch image. It will now build your docker image. This can take some minutes. Afterwards click on the "Start Session" button and you have a running session which looks like this:

In a last step, write a short description of what you did e.g. "Worked on Exercise 08B", and then click on the commit button. In this way, when opening a news session your changes will be restored.

These are the recommended session setting such that everything runs smoothly.

## Advanced Use

If you are familiar with git you can use the project as a normal git repository, open it on GitLab and even open Sessions from different commits.
